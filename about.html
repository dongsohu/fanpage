                <p class="name1"><span class="name2">Brownies</span> are also known as a brùnaidh or gruagach (Scottish Gaelic), is a household spirit from British folklore that is said to come out at night while the owners of the house are asleep and perform various chores and farming tasks. Some believed that you would need to bribe the brownies to do the housework.</p>
                <p class="name1"><span class="name2">Unicorns </span>are known for thier purity. They can be somewhat shy creatures. Some believed that unicorns' would only apporach those who are pure and innocent, ssuch as virgin women. They are also known for healing those who are hurt or injured </p>
                <p class='name1'>An <span class="name2">elf</span> is a mythical creature of Germanic Mythology/Paganism which still survives in northern European folklore. In Norse mythology they were originally a race of minor gods of nature and fertility. Elves are often pictured as youthful-seeming men and women of great beauty living in forests and other natural places, underground or in wells and springs.</p>
                <p class="name1">Some <span class="name2">fairies</span> are helpful. They guide travelers who are lost in the forest back towards home. They help with household chores, often going to work overnight, so that their hosts wake up to a happy surprise. If they are particularly fond of you, they might even lead you to treasure, give you magical gifts, help you win your true love’s hand in marriage, or cast a lucky charm over your life. Others are mischievous. They delight in misleading travelers or luring them into exhausting dances that go one for days. They also like to taunt domestic animals, pinching horses to make them gallop, stealing milk from cows, and playing cat-and-mouse with cats. These fairies usually live in hierarchies, where the king or queen is the most dangerous of all. They don’t just get travelers lost; they lead them into deadly bogs. When they take a liking to a human baby, they don’t cast a charm over its life. They steal it from its cradle and replace it with a sickly “changeling.” And if they ever share their dances or treasure with you, be sure that the gift comes with a curse. The most dangerous fairies can declare ware over small disputes </p>
                <p class="name1"><span class="name2">Dragon, </span>Dragon, legendary monster usually conceived as a huge, bat-winged, fire-breathing, scaly lizard or snake with a barbed tail. The belief in these creatures apparently arose without the slightest knowledge on the part of the ancients of the gigantic, prehistoric, dragon-like reptiles.Dragons are mythological creatures that have existed in folklore of cultures all over the world for thousands of years. In Western culture, the imaginary creature is typically described as a giant four-legged reptile covered in scales that is able to breathe fire and able to fly with powerful bat-like wings. In Eastern cultures, the dragon is represented as a highly intelligent serpent-like creature without wings. They can be either benevolent or malevolent. In symbolism, dragons represent luck, power and strength, but can also represent greed.

                <p class="name1"><span class="name2">Cerberus</span> – also known as the “hound of Hades” – was the multi-headed dog who guarded the gates of the Underworld, preventing the dead from leaving, and making sure that those who entered never left. Cerberus was the watchdog of the Greek underworld and faithful servant to Hades. He was charged with the job of watching over the gates of the underworld — devouring anyone trying to return to the land of the living and refusing entrance to anything alive.</p>
                <p class="name1"><span class="name2">Mermaid</span>, masculine merman, a fabled marine creature with the head and upper body of a human being and the tail of a fish. Similar divine or semidivine beings appear in ancient mythologies (e.g., the Chaldean sea god Ea, or Oannes). In European folklore, mermaids (sometimes called sirens) and mermen were natural beings who, like fairies, had magical and prophetic powers. They loved music and often sang. Though very long-lived, they were mortal and had no souls.
               
Many folktales record marriages between mermaids (who might assume human form) and men. In most, the man steals the mermaid’s cap or belt, her comb or mirror. While the objects are hidden she lives with him; if she finds them she returns at once to the sea. In some variants the marriage lasts while certain agreed-upon conditions are fulfilled, and it ends when the conditions are broken.

Though sometimes kindly, mermaids and mermen were usually dangerous to man. Their gifts brought misfortune, and, if offended, the beings caused floods or other disasters. To see one on a voyage was an omen of shipwreck. They sometimes lured mortals to death by drowning, as did the Lorelei of the Rhine, or enticed young people to live with them underwater, as did the mermaid whose image is carved on a bench in the church of Zennor, Cornwall, England.</p>
                <p class="name">The griffin, griffon, or gryphon (Greek: γρύφων, grýphōn, or γρύπων, grýpōn, early form γρύψ, grýps; Latin: gryphus) is a legendary creature with the body, tail, and back legs of a lion; the head and wings of an eagle; and sometimes an eagle's talons as its front feet. This mix of features indicates strength and intelligence. Because the lion is regarded as the king of beasts and the eagle is known as the king of birds, the griffin is therefore a majestic and powerful creature. In heraldry, the griffin’s combination of eagle and Lion portrays courage and boldness which is continuously linked to ferocious creatures. It is used to denote power, military bravery and leadership.</p>
